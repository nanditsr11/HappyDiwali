## Happy Diwali Pygame Animation
This Python project uses the Pygame library to create a festive "Happy Diwali!" animation. The animation includes falling confetti, sparkling stars, and fireworks to celebrate the Diwali festival.

## Features
## Text Display: "Happy Diwali!" displayed at the center of the screen in a golden color.
## Falling Confetti: Randomly colored confetti drops from the top of the screen.
## Sparkling Stars: Stars that appear and disappear randomly across the screen.
## Fireworks: Firework bursts that fade over time.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x: This script is compatible with Python 3.x.

## Pygame: Pygame is required to run the script. Install it using:

    pip install pygame

## Ensure Python 3.x and Pygame are installed.

## Run the main.py script using:

    python main.py

## Code Overview
## Text Display: The golden "Happy Diwali!" text is displayed at the top of the screen.
## Confetti Animation: Confetti is generated as colored circles falling from random positions. Once confetti reaches the bottom of the screen, it resets to a random position at the top.
## Star Animation: Stars appear at random positions for a brief duration and then disappear, simulating sparkling stars.
## Fireworks Animation: Fireworks are randomly generated bursts of particles that fade over time, creating a fading effect.

## File Structure
## main.py: The main code file containing all animations and display logic.
Controls
## Quit: Close the animation window to end the program.

## Dependencies
## pygame: Python library for creating video games and animations. Installable via pip.

## Additional Notes
This project uses basic Pygame functions to handle animations and display elements.
The framerate is set to 30 frames per second for smooth animation.
